Please note that this is not a continuation of the earlier license since the source code is a complete rewrite (and not a derivation).

Requirements
------------

 - cache folder must be writable (chmod 0777)
 - requires Apache mod_deflate (compression), mod_expires+mod_headers (better caching) and mod_rewrite (nice urls)
 - requires at least PHP 5.2

Todo List
---------

- Add content/body to contact page
- Convert image bullets (in home header) to real bullets (or something scalable)
- Fix slider background (switch to png especially the sloping strip, because of jpg mismatch)
- Slider doesn't look great on mobile site, do something about it
- Do some real cross-browser checks
- Ask around for inspiration on more features
