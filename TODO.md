Download link in a file.

1) Is it Good? Well designed? Screenshots must be easy to see.
   Tick  :D

2) Licence? Is it friendly to commercial dev?
   Hmm  :( No mention of licence or GPL on main page, need to look for "About page".
   That's OK-ish, but I'd prefer some mention on the main page.

3) Is it actively developed (preferably by a team)?
   Hmm.  :(  We can but guess. It looks impressive enough at first glance, but!
   I suggest the "Download Now" should include the version number and date of last release,
   so it's immediately obvious that it's quite up to date, and not an abandoned project that hasn't been updated for years.

4) Is it popular, well regarded and well reviewed - seems to have a future?
   Nothing really leaps out, that shouts "YES!" compared to what could be a new and seldom used project for all the newcomer can tell  :(
   A closer look reveals hints, but nothing really LEAPS out.
   Things that impress include : Testimonials, links to reviews, stats on numbers of downloads, numbers of forum members, etc.

5) Good docs and tutorials for all levels, both official and from other enthusiasts. Books a bonus. Ideally downloadable PDF docs to be read at leisure off-line.
   Well, it's there if you look, but Documentation ought to be a top bar link IMHO

6) Friendly active forum (easy to register), not ancient mailing lists. IRC a good bonus too.
   I haven't looked at IRC, but the Forum is up there at the top. Great!  :D
   The forum includes a "Recent" list, as a quick indicator of activity levels, which is good.

7) A wiki - so I can feel I can contribute something if I feel it's been overlooked
   Again, up there at the top. Spot on!  :D

I hope that helps, in however small a way!
